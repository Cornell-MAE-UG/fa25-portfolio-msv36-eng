#### Projects
- **Engine Dissection**:  
  *The purpose of this project was to apply fluid mechanics to a real world object. Our object was a Kohler v-twin engine.*   

- **Torque Wrench Design**:  
  *For a Mechanics of Engineering Materials class, I designed and analyzed a strain-gauged torque wrench. The goal was to start from a simple rectangular beam and develop a wrench geometry that: delivers a target torque of 600 in-lbf, produces at least 1.0 mV/V output from a strain-gauge bridge, and still satisfies safety factors for yield, crack growth, and fatigue.*
