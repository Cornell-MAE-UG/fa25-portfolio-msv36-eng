For a final project in my System Dynamics class, we had to choose a system to research as a group of four with the skills we developed throughout the semester. This project develops and analyzes a simplified single-axis spacecraft Attitude Control System (ACS). The work focuses on modeling rotational dynamics, designing a feedback control system, evaluating performance metrics, and characterizing environmental disturbances that affect satellite pointing performance.

Spacecrafts require precise orientation to aim instruments, antennas, and sensors at their targets. This project builds a foundational model of an ACS by: deriving governing rotational dynamics, designing the feedback control system architecture, evaluating stability and performance requirements, and modeling major environmental disturbances such as solar radiation pressure and drag. The system is represented using standard control-theory tools including ODEs, transfer functions, and block diagrams.

The spacecraft’s rotational motion about a single axis is described using:

𝐼 w\u0307 = τ

Where:

𝐼 = spacecraft moment of inertia
w\u0307 = angular velocity
τ = applied torque from the reaction wheel

This equation forms the basis for linearization and transfer-function development used in the subsequent control design.
