For a final project in my System Dynamics class, we had to choose a system to research as a group of four with the skills we developed throughout the semester. This project develops and analyzes a simplified single-axis spacecraft Attitude Control System (ACS). The work focuses on modeling rotational dynamics, designing a feedback control system, evaluating performance metrics, and characterizing environmental disturbances that affect satellite pointing performance.

Spacecrafts require precise orientation to aim instruments, antennas, and sensors at their targets. This project builds a foundational model of an ACS by: deriving governing rotational dynamics, designing the feedback control system architecture, evaluating stability and performance requirements, and modeling major environmental disturbances such as solar radiation pressure and drag. The system is represented using standard control-theory tools including ODEs, transfer functions, and block diagrams.

The spacecraft’s rotational motion about a single axis is described using:

𝐼 $\dot{\omega}$ = τ


Where:
𝐼 = spacecraft moment of inertia
$\dot{\omega}$ = angular velocity
τ = applied torque from the reaction wheel
This equation forms the basis for linearization and transfer-function development used in the subsequent control design.

My primary contribution was designing the closed-loop control system responsible for regulating spacecraft attitude.
I created the block-diagram architecture that includes: sensor feedback measuring the current orientation, controller comparing desired vs. actual angle, reaction wheel actuator generating corrective torque, and disturbance inputs representing real environmental effects.

I also analyzed classical performance metrics such as: settling time (how quickly the spacecraft stabilizes), steady-state error (long-term pointing deviation), and stability (whether the system converges smoothly)

This step demonstrates how spacecraft achieve reliable pointing without oscillation or drift.


Although the control system is capable of stabilizing the spacecraft, external forces constantly attempt to rotate it off target. The project evaluates two major disturbances:

Solar Radiation Pressure which is caused by momentum transfer from sunlight where force depends on surface reflectivity and orientation. It introduces a small but continuous torque.
Atmospheric Drag which is relevant for satellites in low-Earth orbit where drag forces act at the center of pressure rather than center of mass. It creates torques that slowly rotate the spacecraft.

Understanding these disturbances is essential for determining how strong the controller must be and what accuracy is realistic.
