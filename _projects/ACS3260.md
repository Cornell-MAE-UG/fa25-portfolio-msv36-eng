For a final project in my System Dynamics course, our group of four selected a satellite Attitude Control System (ACS) as the system of interest. Our goal was to apply modeling, control, and analysis concepts learned throughout the semester to a realistic engineering problem. This project examines a simplified single-axis ACS and focuses on deriving the system dynamics, building the feedback-control architecture, evaluating performance metrics, and characterizing the environmental disturbances that influence pointing accuracy. 

Spacecrafts require precise orientation to aim instruments, antennas, and sensors at specific targets. This project builds a foundational model of an ACS by deriving governing rotational dynamics, designing the feedback control system architecture, evaluating stability and performance requirements, and modeling major environmental disturbances such as solar radiation pressure and drag. 

These elements are represented using standard control-theory tools including ODEs, transfer functions, and block diagrams.

## Rotational Dynamics

The satellite’s rotational motion about a single axis is described by the governing equation:

Iω' = τ

Where:  
I = spacecraft moment of inertia  
ω' = angular acceleration  
τ = applied torque from the reaction wheel  

This equation forms the basis for linearization and transfer-function development used later in the control analysis.  

## My Role: Closed-Loop Control System Design

My primary contribution to the project was designing the closed-loop control system responsible for regulating spacecraft attitude.
I created the block-diagram architecture that includes the sensor feedback measuring the current orientation, the controller comparing desired vs. actual angle, the reaction wheel actuator generating corrective torque, and the disturbance inputs representing real environmental effects.
 
I also analyzed classical performance metrics such as: settling time (how quickly the spacecraft stabilizes), steady-state error (long-term pointing deviation), and stability (whether the system converges smoothly).

This work demonstrates how spacecrafts achieve steady, reliable pointing even when external forces attempt to rotate them off-target.

# Environmental Disturbances

### Solar Radiation Pressure (SRP) 
SRP is produced by photon momentum from the Sun and introduces a small but continuous torque. It depends on the spacecraft’s reflectivity, orientation, and distance from the Sun. SRP must be accounted for, especially in long-duration missions where small torques accumulate.  

### Atmospheric Drag
For low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellites, drag forces act at the center of pressure, which rarely aligns with the center of mass, generating a disturbance torque. These effects become more significant during solar activity or at lower orbital altitudes.  

Understanding these disturbance torques is essential for designing a controller that can maintain pointing accuracy.

# Final Mathematical Model

After incorporating both disturbance torques, the complete rotational model becomes:

Iω' = T + τ<sub>drag</sub>  + τ<sub>SRP</sub> 

Where:  
T = reaction wheel torque  
τ<sub>drag</sub> = atmospheric drag torque  
τ<sub>SRP</sub> = solar radiation pressure torque  

This model captures the combined effect of control input and external forces on the satellite’s rotation.  

# Pointing Accuracy Analysis

Precision pointing is essential for imaging, communication, and scientific measurements. Accuracy depends on sensor resolution, actuator performance, controller design, and environmental disturbances.

The system’s pointing error is quantified using RMS (Root Mean Square) deviation:

Typical small satellite missions allow 0.5°–1° of error, depending on mission needs. Our analysis showed how disturbances and controller limitations set the feasible accuracy range.  

# PID Controller Design

To regulate the spacecraft’s orientation, we designed a PID controller. The idealized disturbance-free model is:

Iθ'' = T<sub>control</sub>

Taking the Laplace Transform yields the open-loop transfer function:

Using pole placement, we selected K<sub>p</sub>, K<sub>i</sub>, and K<sub>d</sub> to achieve low settling time, minimal overshoot (<10%), practical torque limits, and disturbance rejection  

This method ensures a balance between responsiveness and reaction wheel limitations.  

# Conclusion

This project successfully developed a complete single-axis satellite attitude control model integrating rotational dynamics, environmental disturbances, control design using PID, and pointing accuracy evaluation.

The resulting framework provides a foundation for understanding how spacecraft maintain orientation and how control theory applies to complex, real-world aerospace systems.
