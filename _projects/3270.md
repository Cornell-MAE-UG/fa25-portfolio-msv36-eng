For an Intro to Mechanical Design class, I designed and analyzed a strain-gauged torque wrench.  
The goal was to start from a simple rectangular beam and develop a wrench geometry that: delivers a target torque of 600 in-lbf, produces at least 1.0 mV/V output from a strain-gauge bridge, and still satisfies safety factors for yield, crack growth, and fatigue.

The project combined CAD modeling in Autodesk Fusion, hand calculations in MATLAB, and (attempted) finite-element analysis in ANSYS. Below is a brief summary of the final design and how it performed.

The wrench consists of: a drive block at one end that interfaces with a socket, a rectangular handle of total length 16 in, and a constant cross-section in the gauge region with width and thickness sized to tune stiffness and strain

Key dimensions in the final design: overall length (drive center to load point) L = 16 in, strain-gauge location 1 in from the drive, and rectangular handle cross-section in the gauge region with width = 0.9 in, thickness = 0.4 in.

These dimensions were chosen to fulfill all requirements given to improve the baseline design.

## Part 2: Material 

I changed the wrench material to Aluminum 7075-T6 as it is strong but lightweight, giving new mechanical properties of: 
E = 10.4e6; 
nu = 0.33;
su = 73.0e3;      
KIC = 25.0e3;     
sfatigue = 19e3;

## Part 3: Load and Boundary Conditions

To model the wrench as a cantilevered beam the drive block was treated as a fixed support (zero displacement in all directions) and a 37.5 lbf load was applied at the flat end of the handle, in the X direction.

**Note before continuing forward:** My ANSYS was not working with my CAD file, and no matter what troubleshooting I did, nothing would fix the problem. So the only way I could get it to work was to use the default material (structural steel), and had to use a CAD file that combined all three bodies together into one component. All values will be incorrect after this point, but I wanted to still show that I understood how to use ANSYS as a whole. I will also provide my code showing the actual design and result I created to fit the parameters required.

## Part 8: Strain Gauge Selection: 

I chose the DwyerOmega Uniaxial, Linear Strain Gauges with Transducer Quality that is 0.15748 in by 0.011811 in. It has 350 Ω resistance and 0.318898 in depth. All of which is within the specifications of my design.
