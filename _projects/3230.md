# Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to apply fluid mechanics to a real world object. Our object was a Kohler v-twin engine. 

# My Role
For this project, I participated in the physical dissection of the engine during our lab time. Additionally, during our analysis section, I researched the assumptions and dimensions needed, did research about the throttle and choke valves, and aided in the calculations of the mass flow rate and pressure change.
