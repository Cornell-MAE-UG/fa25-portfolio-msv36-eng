## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/maddiepic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 My name is Madeleine Vercher, and I am a junior at Cornell University studying Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Business. I am passionate about understanding how systems behave, how people use them, and how engineering decisions influence real-world outcomes. After graduation, I plan to pursue a master’s degree in Engineering Management to bridge my technical background with leadership, strategy, and project execution.

Throughout my academic experience, I’ve developed strong skills in modeling, system dynamics, CAD, CNC machining, 3D printing, control systems, and Python/MATLAB analysis. I enjoy projects that require breaking down complex engineering problems into manageable steps—whether that means building a spacecraft attitude-control model from first principles, analyzing mechanical performance, or designing and fabricating a physical prototype. I am particularly interested in innovation-driven mechanical design, product development, advanced manufacturing, and technical program management.

Outside the classroom, I have taken on roles that let me apply engineering and communication skills in practical ways. I’ve worked as a STEM instructor teaching robotics, 3D printing, and coding to students, an event assistant supporting logistical operations at Cornell, and a Teaching Fellow for the National Education Equity Lab where I help mentor high-school students in college-level coursework. These experiences have helped me grow as a communicator, collaborator, and leader.

I’m driven by challenges that require creative problem-solving, cross-disciplinary thinking, and a willingness to iterate. I love learning new technical skills, exploring how engineering decisions impact users, and contributing to projects that have a tangible impact. As I continue shaping my career path, I am excited to take on opportunities that combine engineering, systems thinking, and leadership to create meaningful, high-quality work.
